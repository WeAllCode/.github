# We All Code

[We All Code](https://weallcode.org) is a 501(c\)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to sparking curiosity in coding among kids aged 7 to 18, with a particular focus on girls, students of color, and underserved students. Our mission is to introduce a diverse group of children to the fun of coding by providing free educational resources and hands-on classes. We envision a world where all children have an equal opportunity to ignite their curiosity through coding.
